Because of where the tumor is located, it requires two surgeons — an Otologist (Ear Surgeon) and a Neurosurgeon.
There are less than a handful of doctors in the region that perform this surgery.
The doctor who diagnosed me had done about 100 of these. His neurosurgeon counterpart hadn’t done as many.
Before meeting with the neurosurgeon we were told that he had a terrible bedside manner but that he was an excellent surgeon.
As we met, it became clear to us that he was somewhat uncomfortable with the procedure.
He said that working with the nerves in this situation is “like trying to peel away a piece of spaghetti crushed by a bowling ball.”
The tumor splays and compresses the nerves as it grows. It’s extremely easy to damage them.
This perceived lack of confidence — and bedside manner — was enough to turn us off to that team of doctors.
We asked for a second opinion from the doctors at the University of Utah.
