In June 2018, I found out that I had a large tumor about the size of a golf ball growing into my brain.
It’s called a Vestibular Schwannoma (in times past an Acoustic Neuroma).
I’m lucky. It’s “the best of the worst” — Not cancer, but it can be deadly.
It’s a pretty rare condition (1:100,000) — especially for someone as young as myself.
Mark Ruffalo had the exact same tumor in 2001. (Mark, let’s get together for dinner soon and exchange stories!)
So, this is pretty terrifying news to receive.
Actually, “terrifying” doesn’t really do justice to the emotions that completely overcome a person when they receive news like this.
There aren’t words for those feelings.
There are a host of hazards and side effects in this situation.
The possibility of death is low. But it’s not zero. I’d likely lose my hearing on my left side.
And, there was a real possibility that the left side of my face would be permanently paralyzed. My wife and I cried a lot.
I had to walk a couple hours a day in order to help burn off the anxiety and keep the feeling of dying off my mind.
