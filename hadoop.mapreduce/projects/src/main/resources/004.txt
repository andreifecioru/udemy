As I went into surgery in August I realized more acutely what this process is like.
There are information and family history forms that you need to complete.
There are things you need to do on the day of the surgery to be safe and make it a success: no blood thinners (including some vitamins) for 10 days before, no food after midnight on the day of surgery, wash with antibacterial soap before you show up at the hospital.
As I checked in, changed into a hospital gown and was being wheeled back into the operating room I saw almost a dozen people preparing for me.
Each had a job to do — a checklist to go over. Hundreds of choreographed actions needed to happen in order for this team of people — and me — to get excellent results.
My surgery went off about as well as it possibly could have. They were able to remove 100% of the tumor and save my facial nerve.
