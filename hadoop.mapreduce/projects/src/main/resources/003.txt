As we searched for doctors that could perform this surgery I had the realization that they are a lot like basketball players.
We were discussing their credentials and what their success rates were.
We didn’t care for the most part what their bedside manners were or how much they tried.
We only cared about their results and experience. I asked one of the University’s Neurosurgeons what he’d learned in the years since he’d started performing this procedure.
I figured that he’d say something like “I’ve learned if you don’t use bone glue to fill up the semicircular canals you get better results” or something like that.
He instead responded, “Well, we’ve got a really good process that we stick to and we have great results”.
This was an unexpected response but opened up my eyes in a small way to his profession and why he’s one of the best neurosurgeons in the country.
All of his life’s work lives in the process that he’s been developing.
He spends his days teaching that process to his students and they, in turn, perform the procedures too.
His value is not necessarily in his own skill.
